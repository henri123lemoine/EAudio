      "\"The superforecasters are a numerate bunch: many know about Bayes' theorem and could deploy it if they felt it was worth the trouble. But they rarely crunch the numbers so explicitly. What matters far more to the superforecasters than Bayes' theorem is Bayes' core insight of gradually getting closer to the truth by constantly updating in proportion to the weight of the evidence.\" — Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner, Superforecasting\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One realistic example of Bayesian reasoning was deployed by one of the early test volunteers for a much earlier version of a guide to Bayes' rule. She had scheduled a date with a 96% OKCupid match, who had then cancelled that date without other explanation. After spending some mental time bouncing back and forth between \"that doesn't seem like a good sign\" versus \"maybe there was a good reason he canceled\", she decided to try looking at the problem using that Bayes thing she'd just learned about. She estimated:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* A 96% OKCupid match like this one, had prior odds of 2 : 5 for being a desirable versus undesirable date. (Based on her prior experience with 96% OKCupid matches, and the details of his profile.)\n",
      "* Men she doesn't want to go out with are 3 times as likely as men she might want to go out with to cancel a first date without other explanation.\n",
      "\n",

      "This implied posterior odds of 2 : 15 that this was an undesirable date, which was unfavorable enough not to pursue him further.5\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The point of looking at the problem this way is not that she knew *exact* probabilities and could calculate that the man had an exactly 88% chance of being undesirable. Rather, by breaking up the problem in that way, she was able to summarize what she thought she knew in compact form, see what those beliefs already implied, and stop bouncing back and forth between imagined reasons why a good date might cancel versus reasons to protect herself from potential bad dates. An answer *roughly* in the range of 15/17 made the decision clear.\n",

Warren responded, \"I take the view that this lack subversive activity is the most ominous sign in our whole situation. It convinces me more than perhaps any other factor that the sabotage we are to get, the Fifth Column activities are to get, are timed just like Pearl Harbor was timed...
